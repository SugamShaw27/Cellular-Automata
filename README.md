# Cellular Automata App

Welcome to the Cellular Automata App! This app provides an interactive platform to explore different types of 2D cellular automata, including the **Game of Life**, **Gliders**, **Uniform Cellular Automata**, and **Non-Uniform Cellular Automata**. Users can engage with a variety of automata rules, visualize them in real-time, take quizzes, and explore educational content related to cellular automata.

## Features

- **Game of Life**: Simulate Conway's famous Game of Life with real-time evolution.
- **Glider Patterns**: Create and visualize gliders within the Game of Life grid.
- **Uniform and Non-Uniform CA**: Experiment with both uniform (single-rule) and non-uniform (rule-varied) cellular automata.
- **Interactive Quizzes**: Test your knowledge of cellular automata with quizzes.
- **Guided Learning
